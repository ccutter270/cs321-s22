****************************************************************************************


Code Files:

- genreadpairs.py --------> Generates (k,d)mers from pattern

- reconstruction.py ------> Finds a Eulerian Cycle with a paired DeBruijn Graph, running collect_data(“whole genome.txt”) will print out the reconstructed genome

- repeated_kmers.py ------> Finds number of repeated k-mers in the reconstructed genome with k values 1-12. 

- repeated_kmer_graph.R --> Graphs the number of repeated k-mer values 



Data Files:

- cs321final-data.csv -----> K and D data collected while running the data

- constructed_genome.txt --> A text file containing the reconstructed genome of the Carsonella ruddii

- wholegenome.txt ---------> A collection of error-free read pairs to construct the DeBruijn graph with 



Extra: 

- Final Poster

- Progress Diary

- Repeated K-Mer Data ----> Repeated K-mer data to further analyze our results. We did not include this in our poster so we put it in here for reference.
